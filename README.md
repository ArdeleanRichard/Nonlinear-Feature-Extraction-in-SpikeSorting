## Overview

This project investigates non-linear manifold learning methods for **spike sorting**, a key step in processing extracellular neuronal recordings. We compare modern approaches such as **PHATE, UMAP, TriMap, t-SNE, Diffusion Maps, Isomap, LLE** against classical methods (**PCA, ICA, MDS, Autoencoders**) to determine which feature extraction techniques produce the most separable and robust embeddings of spike waveforms.

Experiments were conducted on:

- **95 synthetic datasets** (with ground truth cluster labels).  
- **2 real datasets** (spe-1 recordings, Marques-Smith et al.) with dual extracellular/intracellular ground truth validation.

Results show that **UMAP, PHATE, and TriMap** consistently outperform other methods, offering strong separability, robustness to noise, and scalability for high-density probes.

## Datasets

### Synthetic Spike Waveforms (Pedreira et al., 2012)
- **Description**: 95 single-channel synthetic datasets derived from real monkey recordings.  
- **Characteristics**: 2â€“20 clusters per dataset, ~9,300 spikes on average, including multi-unit clusters.  
- **Usage**: Benchmarking feature extraction across diverse conditions.  
- **Access**: Publicly available.  

### Real Datasets (spe-1, Marques-Smith et al., 2018/2020)
- **Description**: Patch-clamp + 384-channel CMOS extracellular recordings in rat cortex.  
- **Ground Truth**: Dual intracellular/extracellular data for 21 neurons.  
- **Datasets Used**: c28 and c37.

## Feature Extraction Methods

- **Linear**: PCA, MDS, ICA  
- **Non-linear**: KPCA, SOM, Autoencoders  
- **Manifold learning**: LLE, MLLE, HLLE, LTSA, Isomap, Spectral Embedding, Diffusion Maps, PHATE, UMAP, TriMap, t-SNE  

Clustering was performed using **K-Means** for evaluation.

## Results Summary

Performance was evaluated using clustering metrics: Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI), Purity, Silhouette Score (SS), Calinski-Harabasz Score (CHS), and Davies-Bouldin Score (DBS).

**Key findings:**
- **UMAP, PHATE, TriMap**: best overall performance across metrics and datasets.  
- **t-SNE, Autoencoders**: good separability but slower runtime.  
- **Diffusion Maps, LLE, MLLE**: strong only for datasets with few clusters, degrade with complexity.  
- **PCA, ICA, MDS, SOM**: consistently underperformed.
